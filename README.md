## Beliefs

- You don't stop doing things because you grow old. You grow old because you stop doing things. *@TinyAdapter*
- Things seem easy when others told you how, but tough when you do it yourself.
- To implement a feature in either 1 or 100 lines of code, choose 10: enough simplicty with no lack of extensibility.

## Taste

<img src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=maxlinn&count_private=true&show_icons=true" alt="wakatime" align="right">

1. Love semantic and concise code.
2. Love structuralized more than non-structuralized, especially for writings.
3. Love simple and extensible programs more than fancy but slow ones.
4. Hate unexciting work, lifetime is precious.
